# IRIS-RoR-Bootcamp-2020

## [Installation Guide for Ruby and Rails](/installation.md)

## [Essential Git](/essential_git.md)

## [Session 0 - Learning Ruby (Optional)](/session_0/README.md)

As most of our participants are not familiar with Ruby, we have created
some exercises to learn and practice Ruby syntax - covering conditional
statements (`if`, `else`, `elsif`), different ways of iteration (`each`,
`select` and `map`) and basic object oriented code (defining and using
class and instance functions).

## [Session 1 - Getting Started with Rails](/session_1/README.md)

The first session is all about getting started with Rails.

We talk about MVC Architecture and different components that make a
Rails application.

In the assignment, we will learn how to install Ruby and Rails, create a
new Rails project and build a simple "About Me" webiste with two pages.
